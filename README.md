For anyone wondering what to do about the hash column in the database just leave it empty the server will auto populate it on startup!
And for anyone having trouble with the database not wanting to save the vehicle when hash is left empty simply put a 0 in hash and let it save and just remove the 0 right after!

Config.PoliceJob = false Set this to true if you want esx_policejob to work correctly! should work with other policejobs and/or other jobs that require vehicle spawning
